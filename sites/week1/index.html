        File:   index.html
        Version: 1.0.1
        Purpose: To demonstrate that I can code HTML and CSS from last semester.

        Notes:
        I am supposed to keep this file as unchanged as possible; however, the people who coded it used random spacing,
        sometimes opting for two and other times four spaces horizontally. Then, the vertical spacing was utterly 
        random. I'm OCD, and this kind of code will bug me until the end of time, knowing that I had a chance to change
        it for the better, and I kept it sloppy because I was time-bound. I fixed the HTML (borrowed from the 
        assignment). 

        I've been a computer scientist for 30 years and have made the following coding standards from my experiences, 
        especially when I was jarred awake by a pager at three in the morning. All engineers who work on code that I am 
        directly responsible for will:

        * Tab horizontally with (4) spaces
        * Vertically align keywords, tags, and keynames. I do not care for keywords being UPPERCASE; however, that is a 
          matter of style, albeit something that slows engineers down in their coding.
        * Vertical spacing should clarify the code groups the developer intends to execute together.
        * A double vertical space makes a nice visual difference before functions.
        * Random vertical spacing only detracts from code clarity.
        * Use the snake or camel case when creating variables
        * Never abbreviate

        Examples of Variable Names:
            <all_lower>
            <camelCaseVariables><OrCamelCase>
            <concise_meaningful_words>
            <absolutely_no_abbreviations>
            <try_to_use_short_words_and_use_a_thesarus_when_you_cannot_think_of_the_word>
            <ALL_UPPER>

        HTML Sources came from BYU-I:WDD-331:week-1/index.html
        CSS came from myself, with examples from Google and various online sources. The CSS is my own invention and may
        be subject to change, as I may be able to improve it or be asked to improve it.

                            The anticipated new novel by Rick Riordan. After Greek mythology
                            (Percy Jackson), Greek/Roman (Heroes of Olympus), and Egyptian
                            (Kane Chronicles), Rick decides to try his hand with Norse
                            Mythology, and the end result is good.
