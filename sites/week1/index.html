        Notes:
        I am supposed to keep this file as unchanged as possible; however, the person/people who coded it made it 
        difficult for me to troubleshoot. I'm OCD, and I cannot abide lousy code. Some code could be better than others,
        this file being a prime example. So, it is what it is. I had to fix the HTML (AND) and am writing the CSS.

        All engineers SHALL format source files with four spaces in this repository and in any code I am directly 
        responsible for. They SHALL NOT format with two or three spaces as some crazy-loo C programmers are apt to do. 
        Work in the real world for 30 years -- not academia -- and then come back and debate the issue with me.

        All engineers SHALL adopt the new 120 character line limit, as we have not been limited to the 80 character
        limit for decades. Green-screen monitors, that held a maximum of 80 characters are a thing of the past.


        I do not tolerate misspellings, sloppy files, or errors that go into /dev/null. After being jarred awake at 3 
        AM, you will not either because a developer decided they could do non-professional work. The application I 
        currently work on generates $80,000 every hour. I've worked on even more significant projects that create the 
        same income every minute. That is why I am so adamant about ALL of the code I write, even if it is for two credit
        hours.

        HTML Sources came from BYU-I:WDD-331:week-1/index.html
        CSS came from myself, with examples from Google and various online sources. The CSS is my own ivention and may
        be subject to change, as I may be able to improve it or be asked to improve it.

                            The anticipated new novel by Rick Riordan. After Greek mythology
                            (Percy Jackson), Greek/Roman (Heroes of Olympus), and Egyptian
                            (Kane Chronicles), Rick decides to try his hand with Norse
                            Mythology, and the end result is good.
